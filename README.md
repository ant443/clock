# Project: clock

## Description
A clock for a web page

## Motivation
Inspired by Wes Bos's javascript30 youtube series(a great watch).

## Installing
Clone/download repository to harddrive.

## Usage
Since the Javascript needs to access the style sheet, it needs to be run on a server.  
You can run a local server(doesn't access the internet)  
e.g. if you have Python installed, you can use it's SimpleHTTPServer module by right  
clicking the project folder and typing the following:  
python -m http.server
Then in the web browser of your choosing, type localhost:8000 in the address bar.
